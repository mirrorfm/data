# Mirror.FM data 🎵

Anyone can add new YouTube channels or Discogs labels as playlists on www.mirror.fm

## Submitting guidelines

Please only submit channels or labels following these criteria.

### YouTube channels

 - channel tracks seem to be formatted correctly, for example: `Artist – Track`
 - most channel tracks are single tracks, not "full EP", "full album" or a mix
 - have a decent amount of tracks (~50+) 
 - doesn't belong to a single artist
 - doesn't have a matching record label on [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com/search/?type=label), in which case it should be added as a [Discogs label](https://github.com/mirrorfm/data#discogs-labels)

### Discogs labels

Most should already follow community-driven standards, feel free to add any!
